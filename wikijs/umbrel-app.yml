  The most powerful and extensible open source Wiki software.


  Not all teams need the same set of features. That's why Wiki.js offers a wide range of modules that can be turned on/off on demand.


  It's not just about being free, it also means anyone can contribute new features and help squash bugs. Wiki.js is proudly licensed under AGPLv3.


  Connect your wiki with an ever-expanding list of external integrations for authentication, logging, rendering, search and storage.
